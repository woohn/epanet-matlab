epanet-matlab
=============

Description
-----------
This product consists of a set of Matlab wrappers that allow use of the EPANET and EPANET-MSX programmer's toolkit APIs from within the Matlab environment. The Matlab functions share names with the C-language API functions. Usage of the Matlab functions is similar; the argument lists are identical, with the exception that Matlab separates input and output arguments. User's of the EPANET or EPANET-MSX APIs with Matlab programming experience should be able to make efficient use of this product.

In addition to the Matlab API wrappers, this product includes a small number of utility routines that, for example, allow for plotting of the network using Matlab graphics.

For reference see: EPANET programmer's toolkit Windows help file, and EPANET/MSX User's Guide.


Requirements:
-------------
Following files have to be in the search path: %(easiest is to copy them in the working directory)
- epanet2.dll
- epanet2.h
- epanetmsx.dll
- epanetmsx.h


Also added to the path should be locations for the included directories:
- EPANET toolkit matlab wrappers
- MSX matlab wrappers
- Test files
- Utils files

Use:
----
The frame of a toolkit application should always have the
following form:

    global EN_CONSTANT
    global MSX_CONSTANT

    %load libraries
    %start EPANET toolkit
    ENMatlabSetup('epanet2','epanet2.h');

    %start MSX toolkit
    MSXMatlabSetup('epanetmsx','epanetmsx.h');
    
    %open hydraulic network
    [errcode] = ENopen(inpfn, rptfn, '');
    
    % Open the MSX file
    [errcode] = MSXopen(msxfn);
    ...
    %close MSX file
    MSXclose();

    %close hydraulic network
    ENclose();

    %unload libraries
    ENMatlabCleanup();
    MSXMatlabCleanup();


Examples for the use of the EPANET toolkit and the MSX toolkit
can be found in the test folder.


Notes:
------

- predefined objects are stored in the global structures
`EN_CONSTANT` and `MSX_CONSTANT`. Thus functions that require the
input of an object must be called as can be observed in the example below:

        [errcode,value]=ENgetlinkvalue(index,EN_CONSTANT.EN_LENGTH);

    The prefix of `EN_CONSTANT.` or `MSX_CONSTANT.` is required for all object inputs even though this is not indicated in the help files. The help file for the above example would only say:

        [errcode,value]=ENgetlinkvalue(index,EN_LENGTH);

    Alternatively, numeric codes can be used as indicated in the help files.

- index numbers and id (names) of nodes, links, species etc. do not necessarily coincide.
 
For Mac Users:
--------------
- For whom has an error with "-bash: gcc-4.2: command not found" in Mac environment after setting up environment. Recent versions of Matlab in Mac (2011a,b or 2012a,b) need to be patched (http://www.mathworks.com/support/solutions/en/data/1-FR6LXJ/) since Xcode 4.2 - 4.5 has compatibility issue with Matlab.
